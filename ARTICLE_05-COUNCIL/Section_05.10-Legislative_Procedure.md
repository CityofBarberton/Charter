All legislative action of Council shall be by resolution or ordinance introduced in written or printed form, each of which shall contain no more than one subject, which subject shall be clearly expressed in its title.
No resolution or ordinance shall be revised or amended unless the resolution or ordinance superseding it contains the entire resolution or ordinance so revised or amended; or the section or sections so revised or amended, and, having been revised or amended, the original resolution or ordinance, or section or sections, shall be considered to be repealed.
An affirmative vote of at least five (5) members of Council shall be required for the enactment of every resolution or ordinance, unless a larger number be required by the provisions of this Charter.
Every resolution or ordinance shall be read at three (3) different, regular Council meetings, unless Council votes to suspend the rule requiring separate readings, which reading or readings shall be by title only unless otherwise directed by a majority vote of Council. Such suspension of the rule shall require the affirmative vote of at least six (6) members of Council if all members are present, or the affirmative vote of at least five (5) members if one or more members are absent.
