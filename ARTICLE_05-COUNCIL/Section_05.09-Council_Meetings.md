Council shall, by ordinance, make provision for the time and place of regular meetings of Council and the method of calling special meetings of Council. A majority of the members of Council, excluding the President of Council, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting, but a lesser number may adjourn the meeting from time to time and compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as may be prescribed by ordinance. At any meeting at which a quorum is present, any ordinance or resolution may be passed or adopted, or any other action may be taken, by the affirmative vote of five (5) members of Council unless a larger number be required by the provisions of this Charter. The Clerk of Council shall keep a record of its proceedings in a journal in which the yea and nay vote of each Councilman voting on an ordinance, resolution, or other measure shall be recorded. All meetings of Council shall be open to the public as per Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code and its journal shall be available for public inspection at all reasonable times.
